**Prompt for AI Task Optimization Improvement:**

---

**Objective:** Enhance the existing AI task optimization system to incorporate an automatic allocation feature based on employee efficiency and workload management.

**Requirements:**

1. **Employee Efficiency Tracking:**
   - Implement a mechanism to continuously monitor and evaluate the efficiency of each employee based on predefined performance metrics (e.g., task completion time, quality of work, feedback scores).
   - Create a scoring system that updates in real-time as tasks are completed or new tasks are assigned.

2. **Task Allocation Logic:**
   - Develop an algorithm that automatically assigns tasks to employees based on their efficiency scores. The algorithm should prioritize high-efficiency employees for high-priority tasks.
   - Ensure that if an employee's workload exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., a maximum number of active tasks), the system automatically reallocates low-priority tasks to other employees with available capacity.

3. **Dynamic Workload Management:**
   - Introduce a feature that dynamically adjusts task assignments based on real-time workload data. This includes tracking task completion rates and employee availability.
   - Implement notifications or alerts for employees when they are nearing their workload limits and suggest potential reallocation of tasks.

4. **User Interface Update:**
   - Modify the existing user interface to display employee efficiency scores and current workload status for better visibility during task allocation.
   - Provide options for managers to manually intervene in the task allocation process if necessary, while still leveraging the automated system.

5. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Conduct thorough testing of the new allocation algorithm to ensure it functions as expected under various scenarios (e.g., varying employee efficiencies, different task priorities).
   - Gather feedback from end users to identify any issues or areas for improvement post-implementation.

**Deliverables:**
- A detailed design document outlining the new features and algorithms.
- Updated codebase with the implemented changes.
- User acceptance testing (UAT) results and feedback summary.
